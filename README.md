# privacy-toolkit

This is an open source library which helps examine datasets for important privacy related properties. You can use data you have in CSV format, and examine k-Anonymity, l-diversity, etc. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first library which provides off-the-shelf methods to conveniently calculate these properties.

# Features

- K-Anonymity
- L-Diversity

I am working on adding the following features:
- t-Closeness
- delta-presence
- Differential Privacy
